      "\n",
      "* Elephants have been observed showing compassion towards each other when one is grieving or distressed.\n",
      "* They have a sophisticated communication system that includes vocalizations (like trumpeting), body language, and even touch (like gentle stroking with their trunks).\n",
      "* They can remember and recognize individual members of their herd, as well as human caregivers, after many years.\n",
      "* Elephants have been known to help each other in times of need, like rescuing a trapped family member or providing food for another elephant who has lost its way.\n",
      "\n",
      "These cognitive abilities are thought to be linked to the development of large brain-to-body mass ratios, similar to those found in humans and dolphins. In fact, elephants have one of the largest brains among land animals, weighing around 5 kg (11 lbs) each!\n"
